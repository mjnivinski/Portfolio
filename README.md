Presented Code by Martin Nivinski.
All of the code present in this file come from the use of python programming to solve mathematical problems. Mostly from the website https://projecteuler.net/. Each file is self contained and does not require inclusion of other files or libraries.

# **NOTE**
All code is improved until answers can be obtained in 60 seconds. This time was suggested as reasonable by https://projecteuler.net/ and is used merely as a standard.
